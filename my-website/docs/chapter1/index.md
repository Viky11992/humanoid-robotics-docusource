## Introduction to Kinematics

Kinematics is the study of motion without considering the forces that cause it. In robotics, kinematics deals with the geometric relationships between the various links and joints of a robot arm or a humanoid's limbs, describing their position, orientation, and velocity in space.

## Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics involves calculating the position and orientation of the robot's end-effector (e.g., hand or foot) given the joint angles or displacements. This is typically done using transformation matrices or Denavit-Hartenberg parameters.

## Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics is the more complex problem of determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired position and orientation of the end-effector. This often involves solving non-linear equations and can have multiple solutions or no solution at all.

## Introduction to Dynamics

Dynamics is the study of motion considering the forces and torques that cause it. In robotics, dynamics is crucial for understanding how to control a robot's movement, especially in scenarios involving heavy loads, high speeds, or interaction with the environment.

## Newton-Euler and Lagrange Formulations

Two common approaches to robot dynamics are the Newton-Euler formulation (which focuses on forces and moments on individual links) and the Lagrange formulation (which uses energy principles to derive equations of motion).

## Control of Robot Dynamics

Understanding robot dynamics is fundamental for designing effective control strategies, such as PID control, computed torque control, and impedance control, to achieve precise and stable robot movements.
