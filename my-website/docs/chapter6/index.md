## Introduction to AI in Robotics

This chapter explores how artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are used to enable robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform complex tasks. We will focus on key AI concepts relevant to humanoid robotics.

## Perception in Robotics

*   **Computer Vision**: Processing visual data from cameras to identify objects, track motion, and understand scenes.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, IMU) to create a more complete and accurate representation of the environment.
*   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**: Building a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously estimating the robot's pose.

## Decision Making in Robotics

*   **Reasoning**: Using logical inference to make decisions based on available information.
*   **Knowledge Representation**: Encoding information about the world in a way that can be used by AI agents.
*   **Autonomous Decision Making**: Enabling robots to make decisions without human intervention.
*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Training robots to perform tasks through trial and error.

## Decision Making in Robotics

*   **Reinforcement Learning**: Training robots to perform tasks through trial and error.
