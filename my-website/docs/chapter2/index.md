## Introduction to Robot Sensors

Sensors are the "eyes" and "ears" of a robot, providing crucial information about its internal state and external environment. They convert physical phenomena into measurable electrical signals that the robot's control system can interpret.

## Types of Sensors

Robots utilize a diverse range of sensors:

*   **Proprioceptive Sensors**: Measure the robot's internal state (e.g., joint encoders for position, force/torque sensors for interaction, IMUs for orientation and acceleration).
*   **Exteroceptive Sensors**: Measure the external environment (e.g., cameras for vision, LiDAR/ultrasonic sensors for distance, microphones for sound, tactile sensors for touch).

## Visual Perception

Cameras are vital for robots to "see" their environment. Topics in visual perception include:

*   **Image Processing**: Techniques for enhancing, filtering, and analyzing raw image data.
*   **Feature Extraction**: Identifying key points, lines, and regions in an image.
*   **Object Recognition**: Algorithms for identifying specific objects within the robot's field of view.
*   **Depth Perception**: Using stereo cameras, structured light, or time-of-flight sensors to estimate distances.

## Other Perception Modalities

Beyond vision, robots often integrate data from multiple sensor types:

*   **Range Sensing**: LiDAR and ultrasonic sensors for mapping and navigation.
*   **Tactile Sensing**: Pressure and contact sensors for fine manipulation and safe interaction.
*   **Auditory Perception**: Microphones for sound localization and speech recognition.
*   **Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple sensors to create a more robust and accurate understanding of the environment.
