# Glossary of Technical Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key technical terms used in the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook. Terms are listed alphabetically.

## Actuator

A component that converts energy (e.g., electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic) into mechanical force or motion to enable a robot's movement or interaction with its environment.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

A broad field of computer science concerned with creating intelligent machines that can perceive, reason, learn, and act autonomously.

## Dynamics

The branch of mechanics concerned with the study of forces and torques and their effect on the motion of objects, including robots.

## End-Effector

The part of a robot arm that interacts with the environment, such as a gripper, hand, or tool.

## Forward Kinematics

The process of calculating the position and orientation of a robot's end-effector given the joint angles or displacements of its links.

## Humanoid Robotics

A specialized field within robotics focused on designing and building robots that resemble the human body, aiming to mimic human locomotion, manipulation, and interaction capabilities.

## Inverse Kinematics

The process of determining the joint angles required to achieve a desired position and orientation of a robot's end-effector. This is often a more complex problem than forward kinematics.

## Kinematics

The branch of mechanics that describes the motion of points, bodies (objects), and systems of bodies without considering the forces that cause the motion. In robotics, it describes the geometry of robot motion.

## Perception

The ability of a robot to interpret and understand its environment through sensors, such as cameras, LiDAR, and tactile sensors.

## Physical AI

Artificial intelligence embedded in physical systems, allowing them to interact with the real world through sensors, processing, decision-making, and actuators.

## Proprioceptive Sensors

Sensors that measure a robot's internal state, such as joint angles, motor speeds, and internal forces.

## Robot

A machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically, especially one programmable by computer.

## Sensor

A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment (e.g., light, heat, motion, pressure) and converts it into an electrical signal.
