## Introduction to Human-Robot Interaction

This chapter explores the principles and techniques for designing effective and safe human-robot interaction (HRI) in collaborative workspaces. We will examine key aspects of HRI, including communication, safety, and collaboration strategies.

## Key Concepts in HRI

*   **Communication**: Designing effective communication channels between humans and robots, including natural language interfaces, visual displays, and gesture recognition.
*   **Safety**: Ensuring the safety of humans working alongside robots, including collision avoidance, emergency stops, and safety monitoring systems.
*   **Collaboration Strategies**: Developing strategies for humans and robots to work together effectively, including task allocation, shared control, and teamwork.

## Applications of HRI

*   **Manufacturing**: Robots working alongside humans on assembly lines.
*   **Healthcare**: Robots assisting doctors and nurses in hospitals.
*   **Education**: Robots teaching students in classrooms.
*   **Service**: Robots providing assistance to customers in stores and restaurants.
