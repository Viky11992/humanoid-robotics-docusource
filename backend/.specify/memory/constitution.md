# Integrated RAG Chatbot Development for Docusaurus-Published Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### Specification-first development
All components (ingestion pipeline, vector store, backend API, frontend embedding, selected text handling) must be defined in specifications before implementation

### Accuracy and context faithfulness
Responses must be grounded in the book's content with no hallucinations; selected text queries restricted to user-highlighted excerpts only

### Reproducibility
Full documentation of data ingestion, embedding process, and query handling so the chatbot can be rebuilt from the published book

### Security and privacy
Sensitive API keys and credentials never hardcoded or exposed in client-side code

### Zero additional cost
Exclusively use free tiers of services (Cohere Free Tier, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, Neon Serverless Postgres) and open-source tools

### Accessibility
Chatbot fully integrated into the Docusaurus site, responsive, and usable without disrupting reading flow

## Key Standards

### RAG pipeline
Use Cohere models (via provided Cohere API key) for both embeddings and generation; support hybrid search if beneficial (dense + sparse vectors in Qdrant)

### Backend
FastAPI with Cohere SDK integration for chat completions and embeddings; custom agentic logic if needed for context handling

### Vector store
Qdrant Cloud Free Tier (1GB limit) for storing book content embeddings generated by Cohere

### Metadata storage
Neon Serverless Postgres for session management, user-selected text handling, or conversation history if needed

### Frontend embedding
Custom React component or lightweight chat UI library integrated into Docusaurus (v3 latest) for seamless chat widget

### Selected text feature
Implement client-side capture of highlighted text, passed as context-restricted query to backend

### All code
Type-safe (Python/FastAPI backend with Cohere SDK, TypeScript/React frontend), with comprehensive tests and logging

## Constraints

Services limited to: Cohere (free tier via provided API key), FastAPI, Qdrant Cloud Free Tier, Neon Serverless Postgres, Docusaurus (latest stable), GitHub-hosted repository

No paid tiers or additional cloud costs; stay within free limits (e.g., Cohere rate limits, Qdrant ~1M vectors, Neon compute/storage bounds)

Book content ingestion: Chunked Markdown/MDX from the published Docusaurus book (20,000–40,000 words) using Cohere embeddings

Authentication: Simple API key protection for backend endpoints

Deployment: Backend as serverless or low-cost host if needed; frontend fully static within Docusaurus on GitHub Pages

## Success Criteria

Live embedded chatbot in the deployed Docusaurus book answers general questions accurately based on full book retrieval using Cohere RAG

Selected text queries responded to using only the user-highlighted excerpt as context

No hallucinations or off-topic responses in testing

Full end-to-end reproducibility: Instructions allow anyone to ingest updated book content with Cohere embeddings

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other practices and serves as the foundational document for the project. Amendments require documentation, approval by project leads, and a clear migration plan. All Pull Requests and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles, standards, and constraints. Any increase in complexity must be rigorously justified.
